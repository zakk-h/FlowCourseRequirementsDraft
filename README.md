# FlowCourseRequirementsDraft

so we have a source that goes to each class in the first layer with capacity infinity, and then a class has edges to a mode of inquiry and area of knowledge and seminar nodes, so three different connections, but these are specific versions for each of them, like ModesofInquiryNodeForClass1, for Class2 it is different and so on. the key is going to Modes of Inquiry, it would have capacity 3 and areas of knowledge have capacity 1. then, from there, they can flow into SS, CCI, or whatever with capacity 1, which are the same nodes for all of the courses. then, those flow into a sink node with capacity 2 for most things or whatever, and if it sums to whatever it should be, they satisfy everything, or if it doesn't, you could look at the layer before and see which nodes there (SS, CCI, etc) weren't at their max capacity
